YesWiki is a wiki designed to remain simple, very easy to install, in French translated into English, Spanish, Catalan, Flemish...

However, with a YesWiki we can build a website with multiple uses:
- Gather all the information of a project or a group (function of "central station")
- Mapping members or places in a participatory way
- Share resources, lists, calendars thanks to powerful cooperative databases
- Communicate information flows
- Cultivate a bit of freedom...
