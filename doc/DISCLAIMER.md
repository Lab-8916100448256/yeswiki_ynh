#### Multi-users support

LDAP integration is supported and required on new installs. It is possible to disable it on older installs by removing the loginldap plugin. **Warning: only do it if you know credentials for a wiki admin account**

At the moment SSO authentication is not supported. It is necessary to login on the wiki.
