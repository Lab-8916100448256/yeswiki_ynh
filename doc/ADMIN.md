#### LDAP/SSO integration

LDAP integration is now enabled on new installs. It is possible to disable it on older installs by removing the loginldap plugin. **Warning: only do this if you know credentials for a wiki admin account !**

At the moment SSO authentication is not supported. It is necessary to login on the wiki.
